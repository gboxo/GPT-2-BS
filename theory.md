### The singular value decomposition of Transformers Weight Matrices are Highly Interpretable



An especially interesting phenomenon sometimes occurs where the negative and positive singular vectors encode an antipodal pair where the positive and negative are in some sense semantic opposites. This is clearly seen in head 3 where we have an antipodal encoding of fire and ice. We believe that this makes sense given that these semantic concepts are probably somewhat naturally anticorrelated resulting in little interference from putting them in superposition.
