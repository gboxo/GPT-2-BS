# Balanced Sentence Experiments

## Previous experiments
-------------------------
### Experiment: Search for antipodal pair representation of adjectives in gpt2

Based on the Less Wrong article `The Singular Value Decompositions of Transformer Weight Matrices are Highly Interpretable` we want to try finding projections conatining pairs of adjectives or pairs of names with antipodal carchteristics. 

### Experiment Exploratory Analysis:
- Direct logit attribution
- Layer Attribution
- Head Attribution





### Patching experiments
- Resiudal stream patching


### More experiments
- Examine the embedding space using SVD

-------------------------
#### Each of the following experiments should be done in for both polarities of conjunctio expecting in one induction behavior and the other extrapolation.
----------------
### Experiment: 1
#### Dataset: Outter semantic relation, (positive and)
#### Intervention: Change the polarity of the conjunction, and check out logit difference for bouth positive and negative conjunctions.
----------------
### Experiment: 2
#### Dataset: Outter semantic relation (gender sensitive)
#### Intervention: Change the polarity of the conjunction
----------------
### Experiment: 3
#### Dataset: Inner semantic realtion of both noun and adjective
#### Intervention: Change the polarity of the conjunction
----------------
